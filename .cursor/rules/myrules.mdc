# Your rule content
Every file must compile without TypeScript or ESLint errors before pushing to main.
Never push to main unless the branch builds successfully in a preview.
Set up Husky and lint-staged so that TypeScript and ESLint checks run before each commit.
Every page under /app must validate its params and searchParams types explicitly using inferred types or manual declarations.
Ensure the page component uses correctly typed route parameters (params, searchParams) that match the latest Next.js standards.
Search the entire project for unused imports or variables and remove them. Do not break any UI or functionality.
Search the whole project and update all catch blocks to use (error: unknown) and safely check instance types.
Regularly audit and upgrade outdated or deprecated packages, especially from Supabase and Next.js.
All sensitive values (e.g., Supabase keys, URLs) must be stored in .env and referenced via process.env.
Run this command locally before pushing: npm run build && npm run lint && tsc --noEmit You can wrap this into a script called check-before-push and add it as a Husky pre-push hook.
- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
